# Master-code
Source code for simulating high harmonic generation through the one-dimensional Hubbard model under the influence of an electromagnetic field.

The code is written in Matlab and can be executed from "ionicMain.m" where I enabled parameter-sweeps over on-site interaction energy, U, in the Hubbard
model. In addition, the parameter "Q" is intended to simulate an ionic effect. It's implication is the opening of a band gap at the edges of the 
Brillouin zone. For model references and numerical details, please consult resources regarding:
